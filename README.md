# Tutorial Info
This tutorial was from Bram Janssen's Medium Post Create an API Gateway Using Node.JS and Express

This implementation only goes through authentication but the full tutorial (https://medium.com/geekculture/create-an-api-gateway-using-nodejs-and-express-933d1ca23322) also adds rate limiting and credit check. 

Great basic tutorial to intro into creating API Gateways!
